# Ethics Audit
#### A project extension to add ethical inquiry into the CS Classroom

This project is intentionally designed to mimic a security audit, a commonplace practice in the technology sector, by replacing questions of computer security with those of ethical soundness. Students design an app (perhaps just by drawing pictures, by only laying out the app, or by actually creating some or all of it), read a short bit of background material, then partner up to audit each other's apps. In the 2019-2020 offering of our app development course, students created the layout of the app in Xcode, so it included no functionality but was more than simply some drawings of the app on paper.

The assignment consists of a few parts.
1. Students were first tasked to "design a social media app". This part is left intentionally vague to account for the many places in one's curriculum that this could be accomplished. Each student additionally writes a statement about which "axes of data" they will need to collect from their users in order to have the app fully function. Some example axes of data might include the user's location, or an element of their identity such as their gender or preferred pronouns.
1. Students next read the following supporting readings. We gave students a 1-page excerpt from each article to read in class.
    * _["The Philosopher Whose Fingerprints Are All Over the FTC's New Approach to Privacy"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/the-philosopher-whose-fingerprints-are-all-over-the-ftcs-new-approach-to-privacy/254365/)_ by Alexis Madrigal, writing for The Atlantic, 29 Mar 2012.
    * _["User behaviour: Websites and apps are designed for compulsion, even addiction. Should the net be regulated like drugs or casinos?"](https://aeon.co/essays/if-the-internet-is-addictive-why-don-t-we-regulate-it)_ by Michael Schulson, writing for Aeon, 24 Nov 2015.
1. Students then complete the actual [ethics audit](ethics_audit.pdf) assignment. This assignment has two parts: the audit and the response from the app designer. You can see the questions below.
1. There are many ways to follow-up from or to continue this assignment. The ethics audit itself has an element of response built into it, and you can hopefully see the effects of the audit manifesting in the app's design. It would additionally be helpful to have a classroom discussion about question 3 in the response. This question doesn't exist simply to make future versions of the project more impactful, but it tasks the students in this classroom to complete ethical critique and reflection, asking them to build upon their own understanding rather than simply take our list of questions as gospel.

You could also ask students to continue to shape their own "ethics audit form" as the school year goes on, as the process of forming questions is a significant element of the hard ethics work. Harkening back to this project's origins as a security audit, you might consider including questions about actual computer security in the audit process. This highlights the idea that both the security and the morality of the app are necessary considerations for software engineers (tying the latter to the former, which already enjoys this consideration in the field).

The questions on this first iteration of the ethics audit are as follows. Do you have some thoughts about what else could be added? Post it over in the [issues](https://github.com/nzufelt/ethics_audit_assignment/issues)!

### Part 1: Audit
_(Filled out by the auditor.)_
1. On Nissenbaum's understanding of privacy, what matters is the contextual norms for how information is collected and used. How might users expect their information to be used by an app like the one your partner is designing? How might they not expect their information to be used?
1. Given the statement of what data is collected by the app, are there any axes of data that should not be collected?  Why?
1. Given the statement of what data is collected by the app, are there axes of data you believe will need to be collected which are not stated?
1. In what ways does the app incentivize compulsive behaviors?
1. In what ways does the app offer users the right kind of control (_e.g._ by mitigating compulsion or similar)?

### Part 2: Response
_(Filled out by the app designer.)_ Given the audit you received,
1. What changes will you make to your app?
1. What changes should you make, given sufficient time, that you will not make now?
1. What question(s) should be added to this ethical audit for future apps?  Why?
